A tiny script for building a website
with Pandoc. Powershell or Bash.

Used to build my [blog](https://www.michaelbuckleywriter.com/).

## you probably shouldn’t use this

This is a *least effort* script to get a website up. It doesn’t
automatically create index pages or RSS feeds. There’s no local web server
or live reload. It’s minimal and manual—it just takes markdown and spits
out html.

## thanks
